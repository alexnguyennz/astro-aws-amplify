# astro-aws-amplify

Experimental Astro adapter for hosting Astro v4.0 sites on AWS Amplify with SSR.

[View Demo](https://main.dy0rr16jdndpq.amplifyapp.com/)

## Usage

### Installation

```sh
# Using NPM
npm install astro-aws-amplify
# Using Yarn
yarn add astro-aws-amplify
# Using PNPM
pnpm add astro-aws-amplify
```

```diff
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import awsAmplify from 'astro-aws-amplify';

export default defineConfig({
+ output: 'server', // or output: 'hybrid'
+ adapter: awsAmplify()
})
```

## Configuration

### Astro

Server and hybrid modes are supported. For static sites, remove `adapter` and `output` (or use `output: static`) from your Astro config, and [follow these instructions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/aws/#aws-amplify). You can deploy the `dist` folder directly to Amplify with no extra setup required.

### AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify uses Node.js 16 with its default `Amazon Linux:2` build image, which isn't supported by Astro v3.0+. You can use the newer `Amazon Linux:2023` by adding an environment variable of:

Environment variable:

```markdown
_CUSTOM_IMAGE=amplify:al2023

#### Build specifications

##### npm
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
        - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

##### pnpm
```yaml

frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm i -g pnpm
        - pnpm config set store-dir .pnpm-store
        - pnpm i

      commands:
        - pnpm run build

```

##### Yarn
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - yarn install
    build:
      commands:
        - yarn run build
        - mv node_modules ./.amplify-hosting/compute/default
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .amplify-hosting
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

### Static or prerendered pages

All pages must be server-rendered by default - you can't use `export const prerender = true` on any pages. As a workaround for static pages however, you can set a manual Amplify rewrite for every static route.

For example, if you have a static `/about` page, create a rewrite of:

`/about/ /about/index.html 200 (Rewrite)`

If you don't force [trailing slashes](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash) or use page links with trailing slashes, you will need to also add:

`/about /about/index.html 200 (Rewrite)`

For static dynamic routes, for example, a route of `/blog/[slug].astro`, create a rewrite of:

`/blog/<slug>/ /blog/<slug>/index.html 200 (Rewrite)`

For base path routes, create a rewrite of:

`/base/about/ /base/about/index.html 200 (Rewrite)`

## Features

### Supported
- server and hybrid mode
- image optimization with `<Image>` and `<Picture />` (tentative)
- base paths
- middleware

### Unsupported / Untested
- pre-rendered pages (without workaround above)
- ???
